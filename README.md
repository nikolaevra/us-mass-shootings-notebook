Analyzing data from US mass shootings Kaggle Dataset

I'm not affiliated with any organizations, this is simply me trying to analyze what is happening in US in terms of gun control issues. Hopefully, this information will help people get insights on mass shootings and how to prevent them.

All of the graphs and information are completely free to use, if you have any questions, please contact me at nikolaevra@gmail.com
